# About the ReBoot Server
## Data

The Server Address (for Java) is `51.81.53.213:25648`

The Server Address (for Bedrock) is `51.81.53.213`

The Server Port (for Bedrock) is `25648`

## Rules

There's no real Rules, just be nice, and respect other people, other people's builds, belongings, etc.

--Amendment 1--

There is now TWO real Rules:

1. Replant Trees if you dig them (unless you're clearing an area)
   
2. DO NOT TOUCH THE HOLY BIRD

      This is not my rule, this is the will of the holy bird

   --Amendment 2--
   
There is ONE MORE real Rule:

4. We don't like the player with the username `Raindev` UUID `1df2139f-e0ca-4882-8185-9426839f2cc5` NameMC Page `https://namemc.com/profile/Raindev.2`

## Changes

There are a few changes from Vanilla Minecraft on the server

The Most notable is the installation of Geyser, which allows Java and Bedrock Players to play together.

### Data packs

I've added a few datapacks that change the game in minor ways, mostly to make life a little bit simpler, since I don't expect people will be playing on this server 24/7

1. AFK Display:

   When Java Players press Shift, they see the list of players online, and with this datapack, players who haven't moved in more than 5 minutes will appear grayed out.
   This is mostly just a simple housekeeping change so you know if people are ignoring you, or just Away from their keyboard.

3. Armour Statues:

   This is probably the biggest Gameplay Change.
   This datapack adds a custom book you can use to change tons of things about Armour Stands, allowing you to create more details in your builds.
   You can learn more about the datapack [here](https://youtu.be/nV9-_RacnoI?si=cSXBl0mpLzYEGjW9).

4. Armoured Elytra:

   This allows you to craft (by throwing on an anvil) a Chestplate and a Elytra together. This just makes it a little less likely for people to die with an Elytra.
   If you want to separate your Elytra-Chestplate Combo, throw it onto a Grindstone.

5. Double Shulker Shells

   This is mostly a parity change.
   In Bedrock Edition, with Looting III you get an average of more than two Shulker Shells from each Shulker (which doesn't make sense).
   In Java, you get an average of significantly less than 2 Shells per Shulker.
   Just to balance these two out, this Datapack makes every Shulker drop 2 Shells.

6. More Mob Heads

   This one's just fun.
   It creates custom heads for Every Mob, that you can get by killing them.
   Each mob has a different chance of dropping a head.
   The Mobs that drop heads in Vanilla Minecraft (Zombie, Skeleton, Dragon, Creeper, Piglin) still have to be obtained in the Vanilla manner.
   That means Dragon heads still spawn on End City Ships, and the rest have to be killed by a Charged Creeper
   In addition, Charged Creeper Heads (which this Data Pack adds) have to be obtained by being blown up by another Charged Creeper.

7. Player Head Drops

   Another Fun One.
   When A player gets killed by another player (or by themselves, with a Bow and Arrow shooting straight up), they drop their Head.
   If you change your skin, the heads that you've collected keep their textures.

8. Silence Mobs

   Just to make things a bit quieter, if you name a mob with a nametag labelled `Silence me` `silence me` or `silence_me` it will no longer make sound.

9. Wandering Trades

   In addition to the regular, relatively useless Wandering Trader Trades, you can now trade 1 Block and an Emerald for 8 Mini-Blocks.
   Mini-Blocks are just a fun little, Mob head-sized version of the block that you traded.
   This is another fun detail-ey thing.

10. Crafting Tweaks.
    A few small tweaks to some crafting recipes, to just make life a little bit easier.
    If you want to look at the changes visually, look at [This Page](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/crafting-tweaks/)
    
    a. Dropper to Dispenser.

      Placing the Bow Recipe around a Dropper will allow you to craft Dispensers.
      This makes crafting large quantities of Dispensers much easier.

    b. Rotten Flesh to Leather

      This allows you to smelt Rotten Flesh into Leather

    c. Sandstone Dyeing

      This allows you to dye Sandstone Red, into Red Sandstone.
      Normally Red Sandstone can only be obtained by mining it in a Mesa Biome.

    d. Universal Dyeing

      Normally in Minecraft, you can only dye white blocks (ie. you can't dye red wool into blue wool, you can only dye white wool into blue wool).
      This Crafting Change just changes that, so that you can dye any coloured block into another colour.

    e. More Trapdoors

      The Vanilla Crafting Recipe for Trapdoors is incredibly expensive for no reason, so this change changes the recipe so that a single batch of Trapdoors produced 12 Trapdoors instead of 2.

    f. Craftable Gravel

      A 2x2 of Flint in the crafting grid now crafts into Gravel, just as an easier way to get Gravel.

    g. Craftable Coral 2x2

      A 2x2 of a single colour of Coral or Coral Fans will craft into a Coral Block.

    h. Craftable Name Tags

      Name tags are unnecessarily complicated to get, so this just makes them possible to craft, taking 1 string, 2 Iron and 2 Paper.

    i. Unpackable Ice

      This allows you to craft 1 Blue Ice into 9 Packed Ice, and 1 Packed Ice into 9 Ice.
