  Instructions on How to Join the ReBoot Minecraft Server

  **If you want to play with the same account across different devices, refer to the "Geyser Account Link" Section First**

  Refer to the Bedrock Instructions if you play Minecraft on a Tablet, Phone, Xbox, or the Windows10 Version.

  Unfortunately, in order to make cross-play with Java Edition work, Minecraft for PS4 and PS5 isn't able to play.

## Bedrock Edition
1. Open Minecraft
2. Select "Play" then Navigate to the Multiplayer Tab
3. Scroll to the Bottom of the page, and select "Add Server"
4. A Dialog Box will open, warning you of the dangers of the internet. Select "Proceed" or, optionally, select "Do Not Show This Screen Again" and _then_ "Proceed"
5. Set whatever you want as the Server Name (example: I set it to "ReBoot 2023")
6. Set the Server Address to be `51.81.53.213`
7. Set the Port to be `25648`
8. Press "Play"
9. Another Dialog Box will open, warning you of the dangers of the internet. Select "Proceed" or, optionally, select "Do Not Show This Screen Again" and _then_ "Proceed"
10. You're Good to Go, that's it!
    
## Java Edition
1. Open Minecraft
2. Open the Multiplayer Menu
3. Select "Add Server"
4. Set whatever you want as the Server Name (example: I set it to "ReBoot 2023"
5. Set the Sever Address to `51.81.53.213:25648`
6. Select "Done"
7. You're Good to Go, that's it!

## Geyser Account Linking
There are two Options for how to link your Java and Bedrock Accounts with Geyser.

The First one involves Signing into both accounts online, so that Geyser can verify that you own both.

Alternatively, there is a server you can join with both accounts, and then link them via the in-game chat on the server.

Both Methods can be found at [This Link](https://link.geysermc.org/)

Follow the Instructions there, then follow the Server Setup instructions earlier in this page on both accounts, and you should be able to play with the same account on multiple different platforms
